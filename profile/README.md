# shAave

shAave has rebranded as [Pesto](https://pesto.finance).

The protocol code has moved to a new [repo](https://github.com/chainrule-labs/pesto-contracts).

Pesto is a minimal, on-chain derivatives protocol that enables users to create independent positions in a single transaction, offering varying degrees of exposure and hedging strategies. The core protocol is immutable, operates without governance, and incentivizes decentralized frontends.
